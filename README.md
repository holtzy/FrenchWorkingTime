A quick look to French working hours
===================



Overview
--------
In March 2018, massive strikes disrupt train travel in France. A debate is open concerning the condition of train worker in the country. [Antoine Rouillard-Pérain](https://twitter.com/arp_mal) (@arp_mal) decided to dig further and realised a really interesting plot that he published on twitter.

This Github repository is just an attempt to make this analysis reproducible, and to create an interactive version of the chart.
